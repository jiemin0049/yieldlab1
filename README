Bidding system

1. I use springboot to develop this recruiting-test-bidder.

2. How to start:
- start com.yieldlab.springboot.Applcation.java in Eclipse
or
- you can create a jar file from pom.xml, and run it using java -jar BiddingSystem.jar

3. I don't use configuration for bidders and URLs, but only hardcode them in Constants.java
   This can be optimized.
